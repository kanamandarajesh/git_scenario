Here are several scenario-based Git interview questions, along with their answers:

### 1. **Scenario: You accidentally committed a sensitive file, like an API key, to the repository. What do you do?**
**Answer:**
To remove the sensitive file from the repository and its history, follow these steps:

- **Remove the file from the latest commit**:
  ```bash
  git rm --cached <file-path>
  git commit -m "Remove sensitive file from repo"
  git push origin <branch>
  ```

- **Rewrite the commit history to remove the file completely** using `filter-branch` or the more modern `filter-repo` (preferred method):
  ```bash
  git filter-repo --path <file-path> --invert-paths
  ```

- **Force-push the changes to overwrite the history**:
  ```bash
  git push --force origin <branch>
  ```

- **Inform your team** to re-clone the repository, as the commit history has been rewritten.

### 2. **Scenario: You created a new branch, but later realized it was based on the wrong branch. How do you fix it?**
**Answer:**
You can rebase your current branch onto the correct branch:

1. **Checkout the branch you want to move**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   ```

2. **Rebase it onto the correct branch**:
   ```bash
   git rebase <correct-branch>
   ```

3. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Force push the changes** (if the branch has already been pushed to the remote):
   ```bash
   git push --force origin <wrong-branch>
   ```

### 3. **Scenario: You want to update a specific file from another branch into your current branch without merging the whole branch. How do you do this?**
**Answer:**
You can checkout the specific file from the other branch:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name> -- <file-path>
```

This command will update your current branch with the contents of the specified file from the other branch, without affecting other files.

### 4. **Scenario: You’ve made multiple commits on a feature branch and want to squash them into a single commit. How do you do it?**
**Answer:**
You can use `git rebase` in interactive mode to squash commits:

1. **Start an interactive rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <commit-hash>^
   ```

2. In the editor that opens, change the word `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for all commits you want to combine except the first one.

3. After saving and closing the editor, Git will ask you to write a commit message for the squashed commit. Edit it if necessary, then save.

4. **Push the squashed commit**:
   ```bash
   git push --force origin <branch-name>
   ```

### 5. **Scenario: You’ve been working on a feature branch and your branch is behind the remote main branch. How do you bring it up to date?**
**Answer:**
You can rebase your feature branch onto the latest version of the main branch:

1. **Checkout your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <feature-branch>
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Rebase your branch onto the latest main branch**:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Push the rebased branch** (force push may be required if the branch was already pushed):
   ```bash
   git push --force origin <feature-branch>
   ```

### 6. **Scenario: You made a mistake in a commit message, how do you change it?**
**Answer:**
If the commit is the most recent one, you can amend it:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

This opens an editor to modify the commit message. After saving, push the change:

```bash
git push --force origin <branch-name>
```

For older commits, use interactive rebase to modify the commit message:

1. **Start an interactive rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <commit-hash>^
   ```

2. In the editor, change `pick` to `reword` for the commit you want to change.

3. Save and close the editor. Git will open an editor for you to change the commit message.

4. After editing, continue with the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Push the updated branch** (force push may be required):
   ```bash
   git push --force origin <branch-name>
   ```

### 7. **Scenario: You want to list all the commits that have been made on a branch. How do you do this?**
**Answer:**
You can use the `git log` command:

```bash
git log <branch-name>
```

This will show all commits made on the specified branch. If you want a more concise view, you can add options:

```bash
git log --oneline <branch-name>
```

This will show a one-line summary for each commit.

### 8. **Scenario: You accidentally merged the wrong branch into your current branch. How can you undo the merge?**
**Answer:**
To undo a merge commit, you can use `git reset`:

1. **Find the commit hash before the merge** using `git log` or `git reflog`.

2. **Reset to the commit before the merge**:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
   ```

3. **Force push the changes** (if the merge was already pushed to the remote):
   ```bash
   git push --force origin <branch-name>
   ```

Alternatively, you can use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the merge commit:

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```

This reverts the merge commit while keeping the history intact.
